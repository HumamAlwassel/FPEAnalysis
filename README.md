## What is FPEAnalysis System?
Floating point error analysis of simple expressions is a standard topic in introductory scientific computing courses. Unfortunately, such analyses can be tedious and error prone. **FPEAnalysis** (**F**loating **P**oint **E**rror **Analysis**) is a system that automates this analysis process using the (1 + delta) model. FPEAnalysis takes in a program and values ranges for each of its variables. The system identifies and reports any critical subexpressions that result in a high relative error in the output. Users can use FPEAnalysis to identify numerical instabilities in their program, and make the necessary rewrites to avoid such instabilities.
